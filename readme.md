This project is a Proof-of-Concept of a small DB engine specifically for Event Sourcing. 
If you don't know what Event Sourcing is, I've been writing for a while about it on [my blog](https://www.davidguida.net). These articles can be a good starting point:
- [Event Sourcing in .NET Core – part 1: a gentle introduction](https://www.davidguida.net/event-sourcing-in-net-core-part-1-a-gentle-introduction/)
- [Event Sourcing: 5 things to consider when approaching it](https://www.davidguida.net/event-sourcing-things-to-consider)

I took a personal interest in this amazing pattern and after a while using it, I also wanted to write a database system specifically suited for it.
Honestly, I don't know how far this project will go, but I'm having a lot of fun so far and I am definitely learning a lot :)
