[Evenire](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/evenire), from Latin, present active infinitive of *ēveniō*, "to happen".

This project is a Proof-of-Concept of a small DB engine specifically for Event Sourcing. 

I took a personal interest in this amazing pattern and after a while using it, I also wanted to write a database system specifically suited for it.
Honestly, I don't know how far this project will go, but I'm having a lot of fun so far and I am definitely learning a lot :)
